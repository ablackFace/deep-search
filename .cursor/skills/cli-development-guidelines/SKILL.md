# Skill Moved

This skill has moved to the **cli-dev** plugin.

## Correct Invocation

Use the Skill tool with:

```
cli-dev:cli-development-guidelines
```

## Why the Redirect?

CLI-specific development skills (argument parsing, help text, subcommands, error messages) are maintained in the dedicated `cli-dev` plugin, not baselayer.

**baselayer** contains core methodology skills (TDD, debugging, architecture).
**cli-dev** contains CLI-specific patterns and guidelines.

## Action Required

Invoke the correct skill now:

```
Skill: cli-dev:cli-development-guidelines
```
